#Reproduction SICK-NL BERT(je) experiment

This repository contains the code I used to (partially) reproduce the study by Wijnholds and Moortgat (2021). The code presented here is based on the code on their Github page (https://github.com/gijswijnholds/sick_nl), and I have marked all the adaptations that I made. The notebook `main.ipynb` contains the experiments that I carried out and their results. 

This project was done for the course 'Experiments in NLP' at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam taught by Antske Fokkens.
